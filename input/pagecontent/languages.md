### Flows and FHIR Questionnaires

For starting with FHIR Questionnaires as the primary source of the survey structure and text, there are experiments ongoing to use .PO or XLIFF files to hold translations and render Questionnaire resources with the translations. See [this discussion on the FHIR chat](https://chat.fhir.org/#narrow/stream/179255-questionnaire/topic/multi-language.20questionnaires) for more about implementation methods.
